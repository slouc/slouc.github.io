title: Fixed points and idempotency
---

Thinking about fixed points, I realised (even if it's a trivial conclusion) that they can be 
elegantly used to define idempotency:

> A function is idempotent if every member of its codomain is a fixed point.

Fixed point of some function *f* is any value *a* for which:

$$
f(a) = a
$$

(in functional programming, fixed points are super useful and lead to 
interesting things like [recursion schemes](https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/recursion-schemes-part-4.html)
and [y-combinators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator#Y_combinator))

Codomain of some function *f* is the set of values that the function maps the domain to. Given
some function *f*, applying it to its domain element *x* produces the codomain element *f(x)*.

When is that codomain element *f(x)* a fixed point? Let's use the fixed point equation from earlier:

$$
f(a) = a
$$

$$
a = f(x)
$$

$$
f(f(x)) = f(x)
$$

We arrive at the exact condition for idempotency. A function is idempotent if repeated
application results in the same value:

```
f(x) = f(f(x)) = f(f(f(x))) = ...
```

Here's an example: Rounding function `floor: Double => Int`. 
- Every member of its codomain is a fixed point: for every integer *n*, `floor(n) = n`.
- Therefore, function is idempotent.
- Try it:  `floor(3.7) = floor(floor(3.7)) = 3`.
