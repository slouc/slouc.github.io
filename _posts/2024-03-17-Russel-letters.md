title: Russel's Letters
---

Famous for his work in philosophy, logic and math, founder of 
[analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy),
co-writer of [Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica) 
(not the [Newton one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi√¶_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica)),
inventor of the famous [Russel's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox), and a recipient
of the Nobel Prize in literature, Russel was quite a guy.

And on top of that, an atheist and a pacifist. 
In 1918, he was sentenced to six months in Brixton Prison for his pacifist views, violating
Britain's Defence of the Realm Act.
