title: Three types of radioactive decay
---

Here's a short overview of the three types of radioactive emissions: 

**Alpha**:
- Helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons)
- Mass: 4 atomic mass units, charge: +2, ~5% light speed
- Emitted when a nucleus is _too big and unstable_ (result is more tightly bound and has lower energy), e.g. Uranium 238 and Radium 226
- Most ionizing
  - Therefore, highly dangerous. 
  - However, the particle is large and loses energy rapidly, resulting in it being very short range and easily blocked by layers like skin or paper. Only dangerous if inhaled or ingested.
- Smoke alarms

**Beta**:
- High energy electron or positron
- Mass: tiny, charge -1, ~99% light speed
- Emitted when a nucleus has _too many neutrons_ (e.g. Nitrogen 14), it turns one into proton
- Less ionizing
  - Loses energy slower: higher range, harder to stop. 
  - About 2cm through living tissue, 3mm aluminium
- Thickness detectors for QA of thin materials (like paper), tracers (PET scan)

**Gamma**:
- Photon
- Mass: 0, charge: 0, 100% light speed.
- Emitted when a nucleus has _too much energy_
- Tens of cm through living tissue, halved in intensity by 1.2cm lead
- Least ionizing, but most harmful by exposure (due to high penetration)
- Medical imaging (PET scan: after beta positrons collide with body electrons, gamma is emitted and detected)
