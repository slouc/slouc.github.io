title: Why is Berlin like that?
---

Living in Berlin for some time now, I've often wondered - how did it become this crazy place?

Everyone who's ever been to Berlin knows what I'm talking about. I mean properly been to Berlin,
not those two day visits when you walk around the Brandenburg Gate and Checkpoint Charlie and visit
a few museums. And I know how this sounds, but I'm not even talking about clubs and drugs,
although that is a big thing around here - I'm more of a bars & booze guy myself.

What I mean is, anyone who just spent some time
wandering around and getting immersed in the place surely could notice
a different energy than what most cities offer. London has Shoreditch, 
Marseille has Notre-Dame-du-Mont, Stockholm has Södermalm. It's all nice
and playful, with piles of hipsters enjoying craft beers and vegan burgers 
alongside two or three colorful streets with some graffiti. 
But they don't have the rawness, the edge, the DIY vibe,
the face-tattooed girl playing bongo drums on the street. And if you think I'm just trying
to make Berlin sound great, I'm not. It's not good or bad, it's just how it is, and it comes at a price.
You might run into a diverse crowd of young people with colorful hair sharing a joint,
but you also might run into a naked homeless guy, 
drugged out of his mind, rubbing his dick on a traffic sign while yelling "Ashes to ashes". Yep.

What made Berlin this way?

**The early days**

The story starts over a hundred years ago. After the abdication of Wilhem II in 1918, 
Germany was converted into an unstable democratic state known as the Weimar Republic. 
People suddenly felt more free, with less authority and restriction hanging over their heads. 
Drugs became a common thing, with Berlin leading the way, as opposed to the more alcohol-oriented
likes of Münich.

The Third Reich started developing, and it focused on the "intelligence over intellect",
as Joseph Goebbels used to put it. He had a particular problem with the so-called "Asphalt literature"
and "Asphalt culture", mostly referring to the urban, progressive, "big city" mindset, particularly
found in Berlin.
He wanted to distance the people away from intellectual
thinking and towards traditional nationalist values, famously [burning a ton of books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_book_burnings)
  in Berlin in 1933. 

And Berlin, guilty as charged, 
high on life and art and opioids, always remained a thorn in their shoe.

**The cold war**

After the World War II, West Berlin was controlled by the USA, UK and France, with the Soviets
taking the East Berlin. One interesting detail that also played a role: in 1949, 
West Berlin [completely removed the curfew](https://wamu.org/story/22/09/23/how-a-whiskey-fueled-meeting-in-1949-led-to-berlins-famed-techno-scene/),
an effort by The West to show their progressive mindset. To this day,
Berlin remains one of not that many cities (in my experience) where most bars, not to mention clubs, go all night.

In 1961, as we all know, Soviets built a wall to physically prevent the "brain drain"
from East to West. With all this turmoil and shared custody, Berlin was economically struggling. 
It was poor. And as much of bad news
as it was for the upper middle class, it was great news for artists and bohemians and hippies, who were
now even more drawn to Berlin. Liberal mindset, access to drugs, and cheap rent. The dream.

This particularly affected Kreuzberg and Neuköln, nowadays considered the most "Berliny" district. 
Thing is, West Berlin was technically
not part of The Federal Republic of Germany
(Bundesrepublik Deutschland, aka "West Germany"). De facto yes, de jure not. This meant that lots of people
from West Berlin who wanted to evade being possibly drafted, found sanctuary in West Berlin. 
On top of that, lots of people from East Berlin who wanted to escape the Soviets found sanctuary in West Berlin as well.
The open-minded liberals. The LGBT+ community. The artists. The party people. The anti-war hippies.
None of whom were thriving financially - and so-called Kreuzköln was the cheapest part of West Berlin.
Last but not least, being the cheapest district, it also attracted tons of immigrants and foreign workers,
mostly of Turkish origin. According to various sources (easy to Google), Kreuzberg contains about 180 different
nationalities nowadays.

**The fall of the Berlin wall**

And now for the final part - when the Berlin Wall finally came down in 1989, there was a massive population shift
from East Berlin to West Berlin. It left districts like Friedrichshain, Mitte and Prenzlauer Berg completely
deserted. Guess what? More hippies / artists / party folks came in swarms, paying crazy cheap rents or living
for free, squatting in deserted buildings, doing their art by day, and hosting underground techno parties by night.
And day.

That's how it happened. And while those few districts most strongly represent the old spirit of Berlin, 
its vibe flows and gets mixed throughout the whole city, giving Berlin that particular vibe.
