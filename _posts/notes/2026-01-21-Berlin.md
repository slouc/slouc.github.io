title: What made Berlin this way?
---

Living in Berlin for some time now, I often wonder - how did it become this crazy place?

Everyone who's ever been to Berlin knows what I'm talking about. I mean like properly been, 
not those three-day visits around Brandenburg Gate and Checkpoint Charlie and
some museums. I mean wandering around, hanging out, getting immersed in the place. 

Berlin has a different energy than what most cities offer. London has Shoreditch, 
Marseille has Notre-Dame-du-Mont, Stockholm has Södermalm, and so on. 
It's all nice and playful, with piles of hipsters enjoying craft beers and vegan burgers 
alongside a few graffiti-colored streets. 
But they don't have the rawness, the edge, the DIY vibe,
the fully naked guy rubbing on a traffic sign while yelling "Ashes to ashes". Yep. 

(in my opinion, the only place that compares to this is New York City, but that's a story for another time)

So, what made Berlin this way?

_Come for the party. Stay for the vibe._

**The early days**

The story starts over a hundred years ago. After the abdication of Wilhelm II in 1918, 
Germany was converted into an unstable democratic state known as the Weimar Republic. 
People suddenly felt more free, with less authority and restriction hanging over their heads. 
Drugs became a common thing, with Berlin leading the way, as opposed to the more alcohol-oriented
places like Münich.

The upcoming Third Reich focused on the "intelligence over intellect",
as Joseph Goebbels put it. He had a particular problem with the so-called "Asphalt literature"
and "Asphalt culture", mostly referring to the urban progressive "big city" mindset, particularly
found in Berlin.
He wanted to distance the people away from intellectual
thinking and towards traditional nationalist values, famously [burning a ton of books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_book_burnings)
  in Berlin in 1933. 

Berlin, guilty as charged, 
high on life and art and opioids, remained a thorn in their shoe.
Hitler regarded it as "dirty", a hotbed of communist, Jewish, liberal, and intellectual resistance, a center of "degeneration". 
He even hired a guy named Albert Speer to completely raze it and rebuild it as a massive capital of
his global empire, renamed "Germania" (some works already started, such as the 
[relocation of the Berlin Victory Column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Victory_Column#Locations)... but
most of them got postponed due to, well, other plans).

Berlin was already a [hotspot for homosexuals](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/history-homosexuality-berlin) at this time, 
another testament to its liberal mindset.

**The cold war**

After World War II, West Berlin was controlled by the USA, UK and France. East Berlin was controlled by the Soviets. 
One interesting event happened in 1949 - 
West Berlin [completely removed the curfew](https://wamu.org/story/22/09/23/how-a-whiskey-fueled-meeting-in-1949-led-to-berlins-famed-techno-scene/),
an effort by The West to show their progressive mindset. To this day,
Berlin remained one of not that many cities in the world where most bars, not to mention clubs, go all night.

In 1961, Soviets built the famous wall to physically prevent the "brain drain"
from East to West. With all this turmoil and shared custody, Berlin was economically struggling. 
It was poor. It was bad news for the aspiring middle class, but great news for aspiring artists and bohemians, who were
completely drawn to it.
And there was one part of Berlin that particularly attracted this kind of audience - Kreuzberg / Neuköln.
Placed at the very end of West Berlin, it was the poorest district that had everything:
liberal mindset, access to drugs, and cheap rent. The dream. 
And it wasn't just the artists and misfits and drug enthusiasts; as part of the so-called 
[Gasterbeiters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastarbeiter) program, lots of foreign workers (mostly Turkish) also started
[flocking to Kreuzberg in large numbers](https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/westberlin-70er-kreuzberg-turkisch-gastarbeiter-100.html).
It attracted other exapts too - modern Kreuzberg hosts about [180 different
nationalities](https://www.berlin.de/en/districts/kreuzberg/). To add more color - it also boasts
the [highest incidence of STDs](https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article410950553/friedrichshain-kreuzberg-hat-die-hoechste-inzidenz-bei-geschlechtskrankheiten-deutschlandweit.html) in Germany.
Hey, that's the price of the Kreuzberg lifestyle.

**The fall of the Berlin wall**

When the Berlin Wall finally came down in 1989, there was a massive population shift
from East Berlin to West Berlin. It left districts like Friedrichshain, Mitte and Prenzlauer Berg completely
deserted. Guess what? More hippies / artists / party folks came in swarms, not just from other parts of Berlin
and Germany, but the world, paying crazy cheap rents or living
for free, squatting in deserted buildings, doing their art by day, and hosting underground techno parties by night.
And probably day. 
Kreuzberg and its bad brother Neukölln remained the soul of the "crazy Berlin", 
but a lot of it was spread out through these suddenly-popular boho neighbourhoods of East Berlin, and I must admit I prefer them to their Western counterparts.

Of course, these districts are getting quite gentrified nowadays, with vegan brunch places replacing old
techno basements - but a lot of it is still there. Despite being a place for families and professionals too,
it still remains that typical old rugged Berlin that developed for over a hundred years.
