title: What made Berlin this way?
---

Living in Berlin for some time now, I often wonder - how did it become this crazy place?

Everyone who's ever been knows what I'm talking about (I mean like properly been, 
not a three-day visit around Brandenburg Gate and
some museums).
Most cities have a "hipster hood" or two, but it's just different here, for better or worse.
Its raw, genuine, authentic energy is deeply ingrained into the city DNA. It's very much
a "love it or hate it" place, but if you love it, it's impossible to replace.

What made Berlin this way? What gave it this unique character, which doesn't just manifest in the 
well-known party life, but in the overall vibe, the quirkiness, the "anything goes and everyone is welcome"
atmosphere?

**The early days**

The story starts over a hundred years ago. After the abdication of Wilhelm II in 1918, 
Germany was converted into an unstable democratic state known as the Weimar Republic. 
People suddenly felt more free, with less authority and restriction hanging over their heads. 
Drugs became a common thing, with Berlin leading the way, as opposed to the more alcohol-oriented
places like Münich.

The upcoming Third Reich focused on the "intelligence over intellect",
as Joseph Goebbels put it. He had a particular problem with the so-called "Asphalt literature"
and "Asphalt culture", mostly referring to the urban progressive "big city" mindset, particularly
found in Berlin.
He wanted to distance the people away from intellectual
thinking and towards traditional nationalist values, famously [burning a ton of books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_book_burnings)
  in Berlin in 1933. 

Berlin, guilty as charged, 
high on life and art and opioids, remained a thorn in their shoe.
Hitler regarded it as "dirty", a hotbed of communist, Jewish, liberal, and intellectual resistance, a center of "degeneration". 
He even hired a guy named Albert Speer to completely raze it and rebuild it as a massive capital of
his global empire, renamed "Germania" (some works already started, such as the 
[relocation of the Berlin Victory Column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Victory_Column#Locations)... but
most of them got postponed due to, well, other plans).

Berlin was already a [hotspot for homosexuals](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/history-homosexuality-berlin) at this time, 
another testament to its liberal mindset.

**The cold war**

After World War II, West Berlin was controlled by the USA, UK and France. East Berlin was controlled by the Soviets. 
One interesting event happened in 1949 - 
West Berlin [completely removed the curfew](https://wamu.org/story/22/09/23/how-a-whiskey-fueled-meeting-in-1949-led-to-berlins-famed-techno-scene/),
an effort by The West to show their progressive mindset. To this day,
Berlin remained one of not that many cities in the world where most bars, not to mention clubs, go all night.

In 1961, Soviets built the famous wall to physically prevent the "brain drain"
from East to West. With all this turmoil and shared custody, Berlin was economically struggling. 
It was poor. It was bad news for the aspiring middle class, but great news for aspiring artists and bohemians, who were
completely drawn to it.

There was one particularly attractive part of Berlin - Kreuzberg / Neuköln.
Placed at the very end of West Berlin, it was the poorest district that had everything:
liberal mindset, access to drugs, and cheap rent. The dream. 
And it wasn't just the artists and misfits and drug enthusiasts; as part of the so-called 
[Gasterbeiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastarbeiter) program, lots of foreign workers (mostly Turkish) also started
[flocking to Kreuzberg in large numbers](https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/westberlin-70er-kreuzberg-turkisch-gastarbeiter-100.html).
Other expats too - today, Kreuzberg hosts about [180 different
nationalities](https://www.berlin.de/en/districts/kreuzberg/). Speaking of statistics, it also boasts
the [highest incidence of STDs](https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article410950553/friedrichshain-kreuzberg-hat-die-hoechste-inzidenz-bei-geschlechtskrankheiten-deutschlandweit.html) in Germany.
The price of the Kreuzberg lifestyle.

Once I heard an anecdote that a lot of folks escaped Federal Republic of Germany (aka West Germany) around this time,
in the fear of being drafted in the army, and they took shelter in West Berlin who was officially 
[not
part of it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin#:~:text=Although%20West%20Berlin%20was%20de%20jure%20not%20part%20of%20West%20Germany) 
(it was controlled by the three Allies countries). As it often goes, many people who despise and therefore avoid the
army often belong to a certain demographic, from intellectuals and artists, 
to anti-war protesters and LGBTQ+.
And thousands of like-minded East Berliners risked their lives to do the same. Just an anecdote, though.

**Fall of the Berlin Wall and modern times**

When the Berlin Wall finally came down in 1989, there was a massive population shift
from East to West. It left East Berlin districts like Friedrichshain, Mitte and Prenzlauer Berg completely
deserted. Guess what? More hippies / artists / party folks came in swarms, not just from other parts of Berlin
and Germany, but the world, paying crazy cheap rents or living
for free, squatting in deserted buildings, doing their art by day, and hosting underground techno parties by night 
(and also day). 
Kreuzberg and its bad brother Neukölln still continued to carry the torch for "crazy Berlin",
but a lot of it was spread out to these suddenly-popular boho areas of East Berlin. 

There's more to West Berlin, too. Take Schöneberg, a former residence of David Bowie and Iggy Pop,
often proclaimed "the most LGBTQ+ friendly district of Europe" (feel free to Google that phrase). 
Or Wedding, the multi-culti, working class,
"rough around the edges" spot that successfully avoids gentrification. 

As a result, Berlin is a fun mix. And while some other parts undeniably lack the eccentric charm of 
the aforementioned neighbourhoods, the overall "Berlin vibe" is pulpable across the whole city, decades and decades
in the making.
