**Book I'm reading**

[The Müller-Fokker Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Müller-Fokker_Effect). It's all over the place without much actual plot, but I like it for its dystopian setting and dark humor.

**Concept I'm studying**

Turns out Alan Turing wasn't just prolific in the field of computer science, but also had important contributions to biology: TIL [Turing Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern). 

**Story I'm exploring**

In 1999 there was a [nuclear accident](https://www.mirasafety.com/blogs/news/the-nuclear-accident-of-hisashi-ouchi?srsltid=AfmBOoq-df5KUAEESb_-cG-AVbg4rvBt_GoFPhVweHdLh9bZsKKWHpyn) in Tokai, Japan. One of the workers, Hisashi Ouchi (35), received 17 Sieverts of radiation - probably the greatest amount of radiation ever received by a human. He was alive for 83 days. (note: you were warned!)

**Music I'm listening to**

Nothing But Thieves has been on repeat over the past few weeks. Hints of Muse, Royal Blood and QOTSA. [Moral Panic](https://open.spotify.com/album/6afyaK8ihj33Chr7A7LqNI?si=huc9hjiKSbOtBwhl7cwZXw&pi=QIW14X1zQ4yc0) is a good starting point.

**Quote I'm pondering**

> "Invest in your bed and your shoes, because if you’re not in one, you’re in the other." 

I found it much deeper than what it says on the surface, and it made me think about all kinds of optimisations and upgrades that I could/should do in my daily life.
