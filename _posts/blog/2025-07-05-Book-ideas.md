- Famous food critic loses sense of taste. Afraid for his future, he decides to fake it,
and starts basing his future reviews on pure guessing and improvisation. Things turn a dark turn when,
after a particularly harsh (and totally made-up) critique, the chef kills himself.
- Three little boys set out on an adventure. They take a boat to the nearby island and start exploring,
running into various "Tom Sawyer"-like situations. Halfway through, we learn that they are actually in an
asylum, running around the backyard.
- Twin brothers have good careers. One is a successful and famous surgeon. The other one a conference speaker,
book author and a podcast host. It's all being milked from the same cow: at five years old, he saved his 
brother from certain death, making the headlines in local news.
After building his whole persona around this courageous act, three decades later, he learns that it was actually the 
other way around - he was the one saved by his brother, which causes a full-blown identity crisis.
- Hostage crisis traps the daughter of a wealthy businessman inside a small storage room
in the back of a fancy jewellery store. Good news is, she is safe - the door is locked from the inside. Bad news is, 
she has a serious medical case of short-term memory loss, so she keeps re-discovering the dangerous situation she is in.
